        Melomanos is the place to find the song you've wanted to practice on the piano 
        so much but hasn't been within your reach. We have specialized in the piano because 
        it is present in almost all music students. In addition, the piano is the main base 
        for later choosing another instrument. Children and adolescents very love the piano. 
        The interpretation could characterize us if we compose musical works, but it also 
        helps us stand out as soloists by creating our own style. There are thousands of 
        sheet music to choose from. The different genres will help you to choose and decide 
        if you want the file in beginner, intermediate and expert modes. The songs that you once wanted 
        to dedicate to someone close to you and you could not practice due to lack of sheet 
        music, you will obtain it on this site. If you want to learn how to play the piano 
        from scratch, we have self-study methods that will help you get the result you've 
        been waiting for. Reading notes in the treble clef and bass clef can be challenging, 
        but we make it easy for you to get started. To learn the rhythms, we have many examples 
        of how to count the beats per bar. Everything we contribute here is done with you in 
        mind, so don't hesitate to give us suggestions. We will be grateful to you.

      <h3>Songs</h3>
      <p>
        Songs nourish our souls. The mood is greatly influenced by the quality of the music 
        we listen to. Songs help us remember. It is a great tool to be able to learn something 
        new or to study our school subjects. Our database is enriched by the most searched 
        songs on the web, according to age range. The songs found here can be of great 
        contribution to the teaching of children and the children's works could not be missing. 
        Children love the repetition of something they like and it is a powerful way to channel 
        learning. With the music of the songs you find, you can achieve the permanent effect of 
        remembering those you teach. It is wonderful what we can achieve through music. By 
        browsing the archives we have, you will see that musical beauty is present from distant 
        times such as the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical and Romantic. To encourage practice, 
        there are examples that lead to the interpretation of some songs, which will increase over time.
