                        <p>Melomanos is the place to find the song you've wanted to practice on the piano 
                            so much but hasn't been within your reach. We have specialized in the piano because 
                            it is present in almost all music students. In addition, the piano is the main base 
                            for later choosing another instrument. Children and adolescents very love the piano. 
                            The interpretation could characterize us if we compose musical works, but it also 
                            helps us stand out as soloists by creating our own style. There are thousands of 
                            sheet music to choose from. The different genres will help you to choose and decide 
                            if you want the file in beginner, intermediate and expert modes.</p>

                        <p>The songs that you once wanted to dedicate to someone close to you and you could 
                            not practice due to lack of sheet music, you will obtain it on this site. If you 
                            want to learn how to play the piano from scratch, we have self-study methods that 
                            will help you get the result you've been waiting for. Reading notes in the treble 
                            clef and bass clef can be challenging, but we make it easy for you to get started. 
                            To learn the rhythms, we have many examples of how to count the beats per bar. 
                            Everything we contribute here is done with you in mind, so don't hesitate to give 
                            us suggestions. We will be grateful to you.</p>
