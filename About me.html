    <h2>Johnathan Ruiz</h2>
    <p>I'm from Guayaquil, Ecuador. My family joined the Church when I was 3 years old. I am now 42. 
        I am the Sunday School President in my ward. I also play the piano in sacrament meeting. 
        I learned that at age 13 when an American missionary taught me in the last three months of his mission. 
        I served on a mission in Colombia Bogota South from 2000 to 2002. I get married in 2006. My wife is Mercedes. 
        We have four daughters: Kerly, Madeline, Ximena and Natalia. I started to study in BYU-Idaho online since 2017. 
        I'm studying Software Engineering.</p>
    <p>I am studying WDD103 and also CIT225 this semester. It is very interesting to be able to learn by sharing the concepts 
        and experiences that we are having. It is a great strategy to learn better and to develop Christian attributes.</p>
    <p>Previously I studied Technology in electronics. I have experience repairing analog and digital electronic cards. 
        I was forced to quit my job in 2019 and now I am self-employed teaching math, physics, English, and repairing computers. 
        I look forward to working from home upon completion of my BYU-Idaho degree.</p>
    <p>I really like a quote from Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin in the October 2008 conference where he said "Come What May, and Love It." 
        Many good and bad things happen to all of us but we must face these afflictions to overcome them with the 
        help of God and Jesus Christ.</p>
