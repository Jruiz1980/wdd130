                            <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return 
                                winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname 
                                long ago as the River of No Return by the people living 
                                near it because of the number of folks that came to visit 
                                and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river 
                                that they never left.</p>

                            <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river 
                                and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. 
                                The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring 
                                ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the 
                                campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>

                            <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV.
                                The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the 
                                United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher,
                                faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, 
                                and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all 
                                summer...but families with children who like to swim tend 
                                to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                            <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the 
                                most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards 
                                the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone 
                                cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have 
                                made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from 
                                Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
                                and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic 
                                formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human 
                                activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>

                            <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done 
                                in 6 days</p>

                            <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.
                                This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history 
                                that the canyon tells.</p>

                            <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand 
                                daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your 
                                visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>

                            <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater 
                                with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable 
                                river experience. The canyon is filled not only with 
                                exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and 
                                ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>

                            <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating 
                                scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated 
                                I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of 
                                rapids and river variances. However, most people are 
                                familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so 
                                we often refer to both.</p>

                            <p>The name says it allâ€”Oregon's Rogue River has some of the 
                                Pacific Northwest's most challenging rapids, with Class V
                                Rainie Falls being one of its best-known attractions for 
                                seasoned rafters. The river winds through pristine forested 
                                canyons for an experience that's quite different than the 
                                whitewater rafting found further south.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Wild section of the lower Rogue River runs for 33.8 miles 
                                between Grave Creek and Watson Creek. To protect the river 
                                from overuse, a maximum of 120 commercial and noncommercial 
                                users a day are allowed to run this section. To enter it, 
                                boaters must obtain a special-use permit allocated through 
                                a random-selection process and pick it up at the Smullin Visitor 
                                Center, about 20 miles west of Interstate 5 on the Merlin Galice 
                                Road, at the Rand Ranger Station downstream of Galice. Other 
                                sections of the river are open to jetboats. A Gold Beach company
                                offers commercial jetboat trips of up to 104 miles round-trip 
                                on the lower Rogue River. Another company offers jetboat 
                                excursions on the Hellgate section of the river below Grants Pass</p>

                        <p>Phantom Ranch is a historic oasis nestled at the bottom of Grand 
                            Canyon. It is on the north side of the Colorado River tucked

                            below the canyon rim, and can only be reached by mule, on foot,
